# IP3R-dependant Ca2+ signaling in fine astrocytic processes
This model has been developed and presented in [Denizot et al., PLOS Computational Biology, 2019](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/metrics?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006795#discussedHeader). 
The model indicates that the frequency of calcium signals crucially depends on the spatial organization of the IP3R channels, including their clustering and co-localization with the other sources of calcium influx to the cytosol. Spontaneous calcium signals generated by the model with realistic PAPs volume and calcium concentration successfully reproduce spontaneous calcium transients that we measured in calcium micro-domains with confocal microscopy. To our knowledge, this model is the first model suited to the investigation of spontaneous calcium dynamics in fine astrocytic processes, a crucial step towards a better understanding of the spatio-temporal integration of astrocyte signals in response to neuronal activity. 
The code can be found [here](https://senselab.med.yale.edu/modeldb/ShowModel?model=247694#tabs-1). 4 different implementations of the model are available: 
- ODEs: deterministic, well-mixed implementation of the model with [XPPAUT software](http://www.math.pitt.edu/~bard/xpp/xpp.html)
- Gillespie: stochastic, well-mixed implementation of the model in Python
- Particle-based: stochastic, spatial, in 2 spatial dimensions, implemented in C language
- Voxel-based: stochastic, spatial, in 3 spatial dimensions, implented in python, using [STEPS software](http://steps.sourceforge.net/STEPS/default.php)

# Simulations in idealistic 3D geometries of fine processes based on recent super-resolution microscopy data 
 Simulations published in [Denizot et al., bioRxiv, 2021](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.24.432635v4). Reaction-diffusion simulations were performed in 3D meshes that were designed from the latest data available from super-resolution microscopy on astrocytes from [Arizono et al., Nature Communications, 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15648-4). The high spatial resolution of this model allows to propose plausible mechanisms by which astrocyte morphology at the nanoscale, notably shaft width, can influence local calcium dynamics and thus affect specialized neuron-astrocyte communication.
