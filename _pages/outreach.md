During my spare time, I enjoy doing some science communication and participating in public outreach events. Communication in research often occurs among experts, depriving the general public from information about the outstanding work being performed in the field. I hope that with my former, present and future involvements in public outreach, I contribute to bridging the gap between research and society.

I have been an active member of [DéMesures](https://demesures.jimdo.com/) from 2017-2020. Check out their [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DMesures), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/DMesures/?hc_ref=ARSZ-Ig1maGPB6uumgyP2A9Q4uq1yoVLq4fU--GujY9oDTHyql0jWP7Kqmzs2Od6BXY) and [YouYube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIn3CucWk1mLgbzE0noO2Iw/videos) accounts fo recent updates on their activities.

I am member of the editorial and director boards of [Papier Mâché](https://papiermachesciences.org/), a website for the dissemination of scientific publications, in French. Our objective is to make them accessible and understandable for every French-speaking person.
