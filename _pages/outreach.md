During my spare time, I enjoy doing some science communication and participating in public outreach events. 

I have been an active member of the French public outreach and science communication association [DéMesures](https://demesures.jimdo.com/) from 2017-2020. The aim of the association is to raise awareness of the importance of scales in science and humanities and to awaken critical thinking of the young and general public. Check out their [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DMesures), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/DMesures/?hc_ref=ARSZ-Ig1maGPB6uumgyP2A9Q4uq1yoVLq4fU--GujY9oDTHyql0jWP7Kqmzs2Od6BXY) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIn3CucWk1mLgbzE0noO2Iw/videos) accounts fo recent updates on their activities.

I am a member of the editorial and director boards of [Papier Mâché](https://papiermachesciences.org/), association providing a website for the dissemination of scientific publications, in French. Our objective is to make them accessible and understandable to all French speakers. Follow us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/papiermachesciences/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/PapierMache_Sci) to learn about our most recent articles!

Schematic presenting the content of the 'papier mâché' that I wrote in 2021, entitled "Le confinement 2.0 : comment la localisation de certaines molécules impacte la capacité des cellules à communiquer". It summarizes the work from [Thillaiappan et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-01644-8) on the influence of the location of IP3R clusters on calcium activity. You can find it [here](https://papiermachesciences.org/2021/02/21/le-confinement-2-0-comment-la-localisation-de-certaines-molecules-impacte-la-capacite-des-cellules-a-communiquer/?v=C) (in French).
