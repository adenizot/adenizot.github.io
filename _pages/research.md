The goal of my work is to better understand how the brain functions, notably how it processes information. For long, research in neuroscience has focused on neurons, which yet only account for half of our brain cells. A growing body of literature supports that other brain cells, referred to as glial cells, are essential to brain function and are promising targets for novel therapies against diseases of the nervous system. I am particularly interested in one of those cell types: astrocytes, which actively contribute to various brain functions.

To better understand the roles of astrocytes in brain function, I use computational approaches to study how they process information and how they communicate with neighboring cells, both in health and disease.
