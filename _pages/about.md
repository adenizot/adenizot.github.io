Welcome to my personal website! 

I am a junior researcher (CR) at [INRIA Lyon](https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-de-lyon), France, in the [AIstroSight](https://team.inria.fr/aistrosight/) team. I investigate how the brain processes information. More precisely, I am interested in how a certain type of cells in our brain, astrocytes, contribute to brain function and to pathologies of the nervous system. You can find more details on my [research](research), [code](code), [workshops](workshops) and [publications](publications) on the dedicated pages.

I have a PhD in computational neuroscience from [INSA Lyon](https://biosciences.insa-lyon.fr/) and Ecole Doctorale [InfoMaths](http://edinfomaths.universite-lyon.fr/), France and a Master degree in Biology from [ENS Lyon](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/en/) (more details in my [CV](cv)). After my PhD, I spent 3 years at the [Computational Neuroscience Unit](https://groups.oist.jp/cnu), [Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology](https://www.oist.jp/), Japan as a postdoctoral fellow of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science ([JSPS](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/)).

Outside research in computational neuroscience, I [teach](teaching) and am involved in public [outreach](outreach) and science communication initiatives in France.
