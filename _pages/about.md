Welcome to my personal website! I am Audrey, currently a scientist working on how the brain processes information. I am a postdoctoral fellow of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science ([JSPS](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/)) at the [Computational Neuroscience Unit](https://groups.oist.jp/cnu), [Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology](https://www.oist.jp/), Japan. I am also a member of the editorial and director boards of [Papier Mâché](https://papiermachesciences.org/), a website for the dissemination of scientific publications, in French. Its objective is to make them accessible and understandable for every French-speaking person.

I got a Master degree in Biology from [ENS Lyon](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/en/), France and a PhD in computational neuroscience from [INSA Lyon](https://biosciences.insa-lyon.fr/), France. You can find more details in my [CV](cv).

Please do not hesitate to reach out to me by [email](mailto:audrey.denizot3@oist.jp) or DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ADenizot)!
