## Let's join forces - Bridging the gap between experimental, computational and data sciences to disentangle astrocyte calcium activity
I organized this workshop as part of the ESN Virtual Conference 2021, Future perspectives for European neurochemistry – a young scientists conference
Speakers: Ana Covelo, Universitế de Bordeaux, France; Anaïs Badoual, INRIA, France; Audrey Denizot, OIST, Japan.
We wrote a review article summarizing the points discussed during the workshop, available [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12031-022-02006-w).
